Left shift ->
Right shift ->
subsequence -> Power set or Recursion

For Recursion  
    1. Express everything in terms of index
    2. Explore all possibilities. eg (in subsequnce pick or not pick)
    3. If count then sum of all steps
    3. If to find minimium or maximum get minimum or maximum  length. eg (in subsequence max length betweeen take and nottake)
    3. Take the best among them
    4. Base case

Memoization -> Tabulation
    1. Copy the base case.
    2. Write down the changing parameter in opposite fashion.
    3. Copy the recurrance.

throw -> Just throwing an exception
throws -> Use to declare Exceptions (Used to say that, it may throw an exception)


Shallow Copy -> Primitives will be copied as it is , but the reference variable  

Deep Copy ->
